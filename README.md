## 🚀 How to Use

Each folder contains code files with descriptive names and comments. You can browse through them to understand how I approached various problems in:

- Algorithms & data structures (C, Python)
- SQL queries and data modeling
- Web development with Flask & JavaScript
- AI techniques like search, knowledge representation
- Game loops, sprites, and events (CS50 Games)

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Implemented **AI logic** for Tic-Tac-Toe, Minesweeper, and more
- Built **SQL queries** for real-world datasets (movies, music)
- Created **Python-based tools** like outdated version checkers
- Designed **web apps** using Flask, Jinja, and HTML/CSS

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C, Python, SQL
- Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Lua & Love2D (CS50 Games)
- SQLite
- Git and GitHub for version control
